Our objective is to facilitate robust marine research by providing a 
reliable repository of quality-controlled trawl survey data from NOAA 
and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. 
Data includes surveys conducted by the Northwest Fisheries Science
Center (NWFSC) off the west coast of the United States, surveys
collected by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in the waters of British
Columbia, and surveys conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center
(AFSC) in Alaska. We are delivering these datasets in a standardized 
format to support a variety of analyses, including species distribution 
models, biomass trend evaluation, and species richness modelling. This 
repository serves as a resource for researchers and as an intermediate 
data product for other warehouses, such as the DisMap portal.
